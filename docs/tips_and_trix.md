Documentation for Ember-CLI. Handles everything you'll need to know about

Good site to find addons for different things. Can be anything, for example:

* `ember-cp-validations` for form validation
* `ember-simple-auth` to to authentication
* `ember-leaflet` to handle maps

To see if something has been done before, simple navigate to the site and enter
a search term. Eg. "tree" to find a tree view.

This will give you a list of suggestions and a scoring based on activity in the
project, contributors, nr of issues etc.

The addon page will contain links to source and documentation. See the [ember
